# ShaderLab

ShaderLab comes from a flush of my thought and I designed this Icon using my iPad by procreate.

**As a computer Graphics fanaticism.There is always much fun studying shaders.**  So I decide to create my personal Shader parser to render shaders at my local PC rather by shadertoy. It might be a project that I will dedicate in among most of my Career time.

ShaderLab is based on `Qt` and `OpenGL`, However, I decide to replace OpenGL with `Vulkan` in the future.

## Feature
- buid-in CodeEditor.  It is implement by introduce 3rd Module Qscitintilla
- realtime shader compile system
- screenshot and recording It is implement by introduce FFMPEG
- Assets Management, only picutre and audio at current phase of course. 3D models will be introduced soon.
- compatible with most of shader from shadertoy,unless there are complicated mutual reference relationships of frame buffers.

## Prospect
I am insist Learning by doing.More features will be add-in after I familiar with related skillsüë©‚Äçüíª.

- Algorithm storage to facilitate implementing same algorithm between diffrent shaders
- GPU accerate using CUDA
- User login,Cloud storage or share
- IC burning,there is a interesting project named HoloCubic,it present screen image in 3D world using prism,there is the link:[HoloCubic](https://github.com/peng-zhihui/HoloCubic)
- As a pugin interact with Mainstream 3D software like UE,Blender,etc.
